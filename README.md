## About Us

Full Circle was founded in 2017 after the realization that retrieving money from recycle was a hassle and this was deterring many people from completing the task.

In hopes in creating a society with an ingrained sense of environmental wellbeing, we are making recycling not only a feel-good concept, but a convenient one.
